### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Biomedical Engineer, showcasing my data analysis skills here. This account contains the source code of 4 Python projects using Machine Learning on data from different domains. These projects are categorised into Beginner and Intermediate level projects. The Beginner projects are titled as Wine Data Analaysis, Bike Sharing Data Analysis and Sales Data Analysis. The intermediate Python project is called Brain Age Prediction, which trains a regression model with CNN features extracted from sMRI images of healthy subjects. The main aim of this project is to use the trained model on diseased subjects for estimating their brain age, that would serve as a measured parameter for determining their brain health. This Github account also showcases a Matlab-based toolbox called ARET, which I developed during my time at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry as a part of an existing in-house analysis pipeline for mouse brain images. 

The technical skills covered in these projects are Matlab, Python and SQL programming, with usage of libraries like Image Processing, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn.
